        Hi and welcome to my page! &#128522 <br><br>

        My name is Irina Tin. I am originally from a small country that was a part of Soviet Union a long time
        ago. I moved to Pittsburgh on April's Fool Day in 2016. Before that I worked for one of the wealthiest
        philanthropists and businessmen of Russia for about 9 years. <br><br>

        When I moved to the US, I had all kinds of odd jobs. Then spent about 2 years in Real Estate. Now I'm a Software Developer
        Associate/Quality Engineer. <br><br>

       I am into minimalism and optimization of things.
