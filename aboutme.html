        My name is Irina Tin. I am originally from a small country that was a part of Soviet Union a long time
        ago. I moved to Pittsburgh on April's Fool Day in 2016. Before that I worked for one of the wealthiest
        philanthropists and businessmen of Russia for about 9 years. <br><br>

        When I moved to the US and after having odd jobs
        for about 18 months, I decided to pursue a career in real estate as I always liked the architecture and interior
        design. At some point I wanted to
        create an app and was inspired by the specialized software that we had been using at that time. However I was stuck on the back-end.
        The idea that you can create something from scratch using only your laptop, skills, and ideas,
        fascinated me so I decided that I wanted to shift into the software engineering field and started looking for ways how to get there. <br><br>

        I found out about the
        Tech Elevator Pittsburgh and graduated in April of 2020. They helped me to land a job as a Software Developer
        Associate and I'm very grateful for that!
