        Hi and welcome to my page! &#128522 <br><br>

        My name is Irina Tin. I am originally from a small country that was a part of Soviet Union a long time
        ago. I moved to Pittsburgh on April's Fool Day in 2016. Before that I worked for one of the wealthiest
        philanthropists and businessmen of Russia for about 9 years. <br><br>

        When I moved to the US, I had all kinds of odd jobs. Then spent about 2 years in Real Estate. That's when I started looking around
        and got into TE. Upon graduation (April of 2020), I got a job as a Software Develope Associate/Quality Engineer. Almost 2 years in and I have decided it's time to learn new things.
        I'm starting my journey as a Security Associate in the very end of February of 2022.<br><br>

       I am into minimalism, brevity, and optimization of things.
    </p>
