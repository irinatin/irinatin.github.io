        <h2>Tips for those who think about attending a coding bootcamp</h2>

        <h3>Before the bootcamp</h3>
        <p class="tips" id="tips">
            Congratulations! You have decided to take a leap of faith or maybe you've been thinking about it for a while and you're certain
            this is going to work out for you. I have talked to multiple people asking for their advices before attending a bootcamp myself. I came up with things I wish I knew
            before the bootcamp and willing to share them with you. This experience for me has been the hardest and most challenging thing I had to do academically. And the most enjoyable one. 
            I hope it will be as fullfilling for you as it was for me.</p>
            
            <p>
            * Start cutting off the social media. We do not fully realize how big of an impact (mostly a negative one) social media have on our brain. You will need
            to be able to focus for longer periods of time. The longer the better. And this is hard. This leads us to the next tip.</p>
            
            <p>
            * Read "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. I wish I had read this book earlier. I was a bit late to this party and read it relatively recently. 
                Two times. “I would rather read the best 100 books over and over again until I absorb them rather than read all the books.” - Naval Ravikant</p>
            <p>    
            * No matter if you'll be attending a campus or study remotely, you want to have a healthy routine. Some people say that routine is boring. 
            Don't listen to them. Routine equals discipline and "discipline equals freedom". Routine will make you more productive.
            Eat healthy (skip the chips and soda), drink plenty of water (your brain and body needs that), exercise (even if it's 15 minutes every other day - it is still better than nothing), sleep well. 
            You don't want to get sick during the program. The pace is intense and you want to be there for every single lecture.</p>

            <p>
            * This commitment will take up most of your time. Take it seriously. I have put my life on pause for 14 weeks and I have zero regrets. 
            You'll be mostly hanging out with people you study with, they will become your friends and the earlier you realize that the better. I'd recommend telling your close family members that you will not be fully available for the next 
            14 weeks (or how long your program is). Remember that this is temporary. Give it all you've got for the duration of the program, it will be rewarding.</p>

            <p> 
            * Start reading more about the field of technology. Try dabbling on FreeCodeCamp.org. Buy a Udemy course or two. You don't need all that if you a) have a somewhat experience in a field, b) you're 
            super smart (genius). I had no experience and I am a slow thinker. You got the idea.</p>
