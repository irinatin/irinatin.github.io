        <h2>Tips for those who think about attending a coding bootcamp</h2>

        <h3>Before the bootcamp</h3>
        <p class="tips" id="tips">
            &emsp; Congratulations! You have decided to take a leap of faith or maybe you've been thinking about it for a while and you're certain
            this is going to work out for you. 
            I have talked to multiple people asking for their advices before attending a bootcamp myself. 
            I came up with a list of things I wish I knew about 
            prior to attending a bootcamp and willing to share them with you.
            For me this experience has been the hardest and most challenging thing I had to do academically. And the most enjoyable one. 
            I hope it will be as fullfilling for you as it was for me.</p>
            
            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * Start cutting off the social media. We do not fully realize how big of an impact (mostly a negative one) social media have on our brain. 
                You will need to be able to focus for longer periods of time. 
                The longer the better. And this is hard. This leads us to the next tip.</p>
            
            <p class="tips" id="tips"> 
                &emsp; * Read "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. I wish I had read this book earlier. 
                I was a bit late to this party and read it relatively recently. 
                Two times. “I would rather read the best 100 books over and over again until I absorb them rather than read all the books.” - Naval Ravikant</p>
            <p class="tips" id="tips">    
                &emsp; * No matter if you'll be attending a campus or study remotely, you want to have a healthy routine. 
                Some people say that routine is boring. 
                This is not true. Routine equals discipline and "discipline equals freedom". Routine will make you more productive. 
                Eat healthy (skip chips, soda, or any other junk food in general), drink plenty of water (your brain and body need that), 
                exercise (even if it's 15 minutes every other day - it is still better than nothing), sleep well. 
                You don't want to get sick during the program. The pace is intense and you want to be there for every single lecture.</p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * This commitment will take up most of your time. Take it seriously. I have put my life on pause for 14 weeks and 
                looking back I realize how right and important that decision was. 
                You'll be mostly hanging out with people you study with, they will become your friends and the earlier you realize that the better. 
                I'd recommend telling your close family members that you will not be fully available for the next 
                14 weeks (or how long your program is). Remember that this is temporary. 
                Give it all you've got for the duration of the program, it will be rewarding.</p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips"> 
                &emsp; * Start reading more about the field of technology. Try dabbling on FreeCodeCamp.org. Buy a Udemy course or two. 
                You don't need all that if you a) have a somewhat experience in a field, b) you're 
                super smart (genius). I had no experience and I am a slow thinker. You got the idea.</p>

            
            <h3>During the bootcamp</h3>

            <p class="tips" id="tips"> 
                &emsp; * Week 1 Day 1. It is exciting and it is terrifying at the same time. At least it was for me. Do not worry!
                You are in good hands. You will hear multiple times "Trust The Process!" Everyone from the bootcamp will do anything to help
                you succeed but you will have to put in a lot of work as well. You will be getting homework assignments every single day.
                Yes, they are not due up until the day after tomorrow. Believe me, you'd want to finish and submit them as soon as possible.
                Do not keep your homework on your back burner. Tomorrow is going to be a new lecture and new homework. You don't want 
                the thought of unfinished assignment drilling your head and give you unnecessary anxiety. This can have a snow bowling effect 
                and it can look ugly shortly. Do not let it happen! We'd stay on campus until 10pm sometimes to make sure we finish at least 90% 
                of an assignment. I appreciated it so much and was able to sleep like a baby every night.
            </p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * Connect with as many people from your cohort as possible. This is your first pool of connections in a tech field that
                you're trying to get into. You will share many moments together and you will be spending a lot of time together. Please be nice.
                Please be humble and open. Be someone you'd reach out to if you needed help. 
            </p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * Maybe you'll run into a roadblock. Maybe you'll run into lots of them. It is important and also hard to know
                when to <strong>take a break</strong>. Hard because you want to solve the issue immediately and you keep driving yourself crazy. Taking a break is hard.
                However it might give you different perspective on the problem and you'll find a new solution. Someone from my class had an aha moment
                in a shower one morning and he quickly scrbbled the solution on a piece of paper after rushing out from the bathroom. This sounds crazy but things like this happen.
            </p>

            <h3>After the bootcamp</h3>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * I got an offer from a large corporation a week before the graduation. It was right after the pandemic hit. Times were uncertain,
            a lot of companies were on hiring freeze. Now almost 2 years later I could not have been happier how it all has worked out. I got placed on one of the busiest delivery teams and it's been a blast. I am very proud of the product we have built and delivered together.
            I have worked alongside the brightest, the nicest, and the most humble people for about 2 years.
            I have learned a thing or two during that time.
            </p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * Never stop learning.
            </p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * Never stop exploring.
            </p>

            <p class="tips" id="tips">
                &emsp; * Be nice and humble.
            </p>
